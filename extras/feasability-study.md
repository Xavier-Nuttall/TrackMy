# Feasibility Study


## Technical -  Do we have enough expertise? YES

Each team member is an Undergraduate 300-level INFO Science student which means we all have experience programming to a high level. 
	
We’ve all used node.js before in previous papers, and we have all interacted with databases. Postgresql was the Database Management System used in the COMP101 so we all have experience working with Postgres.

**Xavier:**
* 10 Years of website building experience, Has experience working with docker containers, for managing databases, and has used GitHub for managing group projects. 

**Dianne:**
* Major in Data Science and minor in Software Engineering. Has experience with website building and coding from various papers offered over the course of this major. Has co-developed within a team in COSC202.

**Ben:**
* Major in Information Science. Have experience with code and website building through INFO papers at the University of Otago.

**Charlie:**
* Bachelor of Science Majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Information Science. Has experience building websites and using databases through papers at University as well as personal projects.

## Operational - Do we have the logistics to make it work? YES

Communication

* Our team will be using the Discord app for communication amongst each other, for use with discussion and planning.

Development Tools
* Our team is using a Github repository as a version control system in order to develop code.

Peer Programing 
* Our team will engage in peer programming sessions to collaborate and review code together, fostering knowledge sharing and code quality improvement.

Learning Tools
* If we run into knowledge gaps our group are able to use tutorials, search engines, AI and group meetups to fill these gaps

## Resources - Do we have the resources? YES


Node.js
* We plan to use node.js to host the server 

React
* We plan to use React for the front end as members have experience using the framework.

PostgreSQL
* PostgreSQL will be used for the database. All members have experience with using the software.

Microsoft sign-in
* For user authentication, we plan to use Microsoft sign-in. This is due to Otago University students having Microsoft accounts which can be used to sign in into the service using OAuth2.0 

VSCode
* The Text editor we will use for developing the project which has plugins for other features

Programming Languages
* Javascript, HTML, CSS

Chart.js
* This can be used to generate trend charts for our website



## Schedule - do we have enough time? YES

Expert estimation
* We have identified the level of difficulty of user stories and the appropriate amount of time needed for each sprint by using expert estimation approaches like Planning Poker. We have an estimated time for each milestone based on our prior projects' completion dates and experience.

Three sprints (3 milestones)
* We plan to use at least 3 sprints to create the basic prototype of the website

For Example:

Sprint 1: Back End Development
* 1 ½ weeks

Sprint 2: Front End Development
* 1 ½ weeks
	
Sprint 3: Cleanup and Finalisation
* 1 week 

We believe that we will be able to complete the project by the due dates due to our estimation and sprint plan.
